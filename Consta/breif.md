# Consta Patio Bistro Code Sprint
Personal challange to code a small website from the ground up in two days.  Emphasis on practicing CSS skills and becoming more comfy with Grid and Flex.

### The Bistro
__Consta Patio Bistro__ is the type of place that serves food on slate and is frequented by young groovy people who wear Beats headphones while slurping on a smoothy.
