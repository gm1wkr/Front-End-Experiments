# Consta Patio Bistro Code Sprint
Personal challange to code a small website from the ground up in two days.  Emphasis on practicing CSS skills and becoming more comfy with Grid and Flex.

Code will be hand written and use no frameworks.  

## The Fictional Bistro
__Consta Patio Bistro__ is the type of place that serves food on slate and is frequented by young groovy people who wear Beats headphones while slurping on a smoothy.  

__The fictional owners, Bob and Maria, are dedicated to their craft and have wicked senses of humour (they told me to make the placeholder text like that, honestly).__

## TODO's

Having spent the time budget (and more) the state of play is okay but has plenty of room for improvement.

### Code
* Improve CSS to be less verbose
* Tidy up CSS class names and rationise overly verbose selectors.
    * Consider using SCSS
    * Consider using loose BEM convention
* Prepare for Web components
    * Use Review section as Web Component experiment.
    * SCSS

## Design
### Page Wide

* Increase responsivness
    * 
 
* Collapsable CSS only Navigation for small screens (Hamburger... Mmmmm)
* Make better use of header on wide screen (address maybe)
* Sort Hero Section (see below)
* Main Panel.  



## Inspirations of note.

* Rachel Andrews
* Jen Simmons
* Miriam Suzanne
