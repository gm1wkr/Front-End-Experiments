# React Official tutorial code along

Tic-Tak-Toe [Tutorial from Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#inspecting-the-starter-code)

## Environment
```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Remove boilerplate
```
cd my-app/src
rm *
```

```
cd ../
```

React developer tools installed into Chrome.

## Super()
The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.  Must be called when extending class in React.  All React component classes that have a constructor should start with a super(props) call.

## Components
Each component is represented by a class (unless it is a 'functional component' as square becomes).  In this case we have the following components:

* Square
* Board
* Game

Since the Square components no longer maintain state, the Square components receive values from the Board component and inform the Board component when theyâ€™re clicked. In React terms, the Square components are now controlled components. The Board has full control over them. 

Square is a component of Board and Board is a component of Game.

## Props
Short for properties.  A way to pass data between components.

## SQUARE
The square component.
